      The "daily_issue_clean" table consolidates cleaned data from daily issue submissions, combining
      facilities information, issue categories, and operational impacts. It includes details on facility
      names, shift types, issue descriptions, and shutdown statuses. Data is organized by autogenerated
      date and time, with classifications for full or partial day impacts and affected durations. Additional
      columns provide context such as full facility details, number of stalls and sides affected, and
      the nature of the outage.
