      The "daily_issue_dashboard" table aggregates data from daily issue submissions, combining information
      from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of facility issues. It includes details such
      as facility names, issue categories, shift types, and statuses like whether issues were fixed or
      caused shutdowns. The data is organized by date and time, with classifications for full or partial
      day impacts and the duration in hours.
